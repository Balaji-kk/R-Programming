### Conditional probability

#### Exercise 1. 
# Suppose a box contains 300 good light bulbs, 60 defective light bulbs and 150 somewhat defective light bulbs. If one of the bulbs from the box is used and it does notimmediately fail to work, what is the probability that the bulb is a good bulb (meaning that it is not somewhat defective)?

## Solution


$$P(G|S)= \frac{P(G \cup S)} {P(S)}$$

# let S be the total number of bublbs
# let SD somewhat defective bulbs
# let D be defective bulbs
# let  G good bulb 
# Let T probability of getting good bulb that does not fail to work immediately

```{r}
S<-510
SD<-150
D<-60
G<-300
T<- (G+SD)/S
T
```

## Exercise 2. 

## DISCLAIMER I MADE THIS EXAMPLE UP - NAMES ARE REAL BUTFIGURES ARE USED ONLY TO ILLUSTRATE THE APPLICATION!BMW purchases car batteries from two different suppliers. A123Systems provides 60% of thebatteries and E-One Moli Energy provides 40% of the batteries. If 6% of all A123Systemsbatteries are defective and 3% from E-One Moli Energy are defective.

## 1. Draw the sample space and event diagram. Label all relevant events in the diagram.

## 2. Label the diagram with computed probabilities for all relevant events including:

# let A be A213 system
A<-60
# the probability of getting a213 system is
PA<-A/S

## Exercise 3.  
## Montgomery 2-49. You must show your work and all steps to receive fullcredit. If P(A) = 0.3, P(B) = 0.2, and P(Aâˆ©B) = 0.1 determine the following probabilities

1) $P(A')$

$$P{(A')}=1-P(A)$$


```{r}
# let A be the probability of getting 
PA<-0.3
A<-1-PA
A
```

2. $P(A\cup B)$

$$P(A\cup B)= P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap{B})$$

```{r}
# let B be the probability of getting 
PB<-0.2
Pa<-0.3
PA_B<-0.1
B<-(Pa+PB)-PA_B
B
```
 
3.$(P{A'}\cap{B})$

$$(P{A'}\cap{B})=P(B)-P(A \cap B)$$

```{r}
# Let C be the probability 
PA_B<-0.1
C<-PB-PA_B
C
```

4.$(P{A}\cap{B'})$

# Let D be the probability 

$$(P{A}\cap{B'})=P(A)-P(A \cap B)$$

```{r}

D<-PA-PA_B
D
```


5. $P({A'}\cup{B})$

$$P[({A}\cup{B})']=1-P(A\cup{B})$$

```{r}
# Let E be the probability of getting 
P_AB<-PA+PB
E<- 1-B
E
```
6.$P({A'}\cup{B})$

$$P({A'}\cup{B})=P(B)+P(A')-P(A'\cap{B})$$

```{r}
# Let F be the probability of getting 
F<- PB+A-C
F

```

## Exercise 4.
##  You must provide a complete, well written solution.If A, B, and C are mutually exclusive events, is it possible for P(A) = 0.3, P(B) = 0.4, andP(C) = 0.5? Why or why not?

# solution


 According to probability 0<=P(any event)<=1

$$P(A)+P(B)+P(C)=0.3+0.5+0.4=1.2>1$$

 Hence the event P(A),P(B),P(C) cannot be mutually exclusive.


## Exercise 6. 
## You must show your work and all steps to receive fullcredit. Disks of polycarbonate plastic from a supplier are analyzed for scratch and shockresistance. The results from 100 disks are summarized as follows.

# solution

```{r}
# Let A be high shock resistance
A<-86

# let B be high scratch resistance
B<-79

```


1.P(A)
```{r}
PA<-86/100
PA
```


2.P(B)
```{r}
PB<-79/100
PB
```

3.P(A|B)

$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap{B})}{P(B)}$$

Let AB be the probability of $P(A|B)$
```{r}
A_B<-70/100
A_B
AB<-A_B/PB
AB
```

4.P(B|A)

$$P(B|A)=\frac{P(B\cap{A})}{P(A)}$$

Let BA be the probability of $P(B|A)$
```{r}
BA<-A_B/PA
BA
```

## Exercise 7 
## You must show your work and all steps to receive fullcredit. A batch of 500 containers for frozen orange juie contains 5 that are defective. Two are selected, at random, without replacement from the batch

## solution

```{r}

# 1. What is the probability that the second one selected is defective given that the first one was defective?
 
# let A be the batch of containers
A<-500

# Let B be defective
B<-5

# let PB be the the probability of getting second one defective given first one is defective

PB<-4/499
PB

# 2. What is the probability that both are defective?

# let PD be the probability of getting 1 defective

PD<-5/500
PD

# The probability of getting both defective is
PE<-PD+PB
PE

# 3. What is the probability that both are acceptable?

# let PC be the probability of getting which are acceptable
PC<-(495/500)*(494/499)
PC
```

## Exercise 8. 
## You must provide a complete, well written solutionand include the image of your Venn diagram. You can use powerpoint (lucid chart, paintor any other program) to easily draw Venn diagrams and then save it as an image that youload into R Markdown or Overleaf. If P(A|B) = 1 must A = B? Draw a Venn diagram to explain your answer


$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap{B})}{P(B)}$$
Given

$$P(A|B)=1$$

So

$$\frac{P(A\cap{B})}{P(B)}=1$$
$$P(A\cap{B})=P(B)$$

## Exercise 9.
## You must show your work and all steps to receivefull credit. Incoming calls to a customer service center are classified as complaints (75% ofthe calls) or requests for information (25% of the calls). Of the complaints, 40% deal withcomputer equipment that does not respond and 57% deal with incomplete software installation and in the remaining 3% of complaints the user has improperly followed the installationinstructions. The requests for information are evenly divided on technical questions (50%)and requests to purchase more products (50%).

## 1. What is the probability that an incoming call to the service center will be from a customer who has not followed installation instructions properly?

```{r}
# Let S be total number of complaints
S<-100

# Let complaint be A
A<-75

# probability of complaint be PA
PA<-75/100

# Let information request be B
B<-25

# probability of information request be
PB<-25/100

# getting call that does not followed instruction be
I<-75*(3/100)

# The probability of getting call that didn't follow instructions
PI<-I/100
PI

## 2. Find the probability that an incoming call is a request for purchasing more products.

# Let the incoming call for purchase is
P<-(25*50)/100

# The probability of incoming call for purchasing is
PP<-P/100
